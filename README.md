# Signal-Detection-Theory
Analysis of extracellular activity across layers during a perceptual task

# Synopsis
A central goal in neuroscience is to relate the activity of neurons to a subject’s
behavior. In this module we will use approaches based on signal detection theory
and apply them to population recordings across cortical layers from macaque visual
cortex while the animals are performing a visual task. Additionally, we will introduce
an analysis technique that allows for the identification of cortical layers in these
recordings.

# Practical work
Most decisions involve a degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty often results from noise, e.g.
whether these are perceptual decisions (Was there a flash of light?), detection of a radar
signal (Did the speed of this car exceed 50km/h?), or a classification algorithm (“Does this
datapoint belong to class A or B?). Signal detection theory provides us with tools to analyze
such decision under uncertainty. The concepts come from analyzing radar signals, were
introduced to psychology in the 1950s, applied to neural signals in the 1990s and are widely
used in neuroscience and machine learning to quantify classification performance.
In the following exercises you will be introduced to the basic concepts and apply them to
behavioral data and simultaneously recorded neural data from visual area V2/V3a of a
macaque monkey performing a visual task. I.e. the monkey has to make visually guided
decisions based on noisy visual signals.
